      ## Introduction <br>
       **Sharpe** is a classless framework for people like me that dont always care how their web app
      looks but
      don't want to see defaults. *classless* means you just need to import it and you're done. No other steps
      necessary.
      This page is using sharpe. You need **not** use any css classes unless you are trying to customize your app
      further. Just use standard html elements like `&lt;p&gt;` and `&lt;span&gt;`<br>
      ## Features<br>
      * Supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)<br>
      * Supports [Syntax Highlighting](https://prismjs.com/)<br>
      * Has a Dark Mode<br>
      * Compliant with W3C requirement for HTML and CSS.
